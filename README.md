Stories Carved in Time
HTML/CSS Assignment 4 – Multi-Page Grid Site

🪵 Project Overview

Driftwood Atlas began as a small artisan collective specializing in handcrafted maps and journals made from reclaimed wood and recycled paper. Over the years, it has evolved into a sustainable lifestyle brand offering eco-conscious travel gear, decor, and keepsakes—all grounded in a rustic, nostalgic aesthetic.

The website design reflects the brand’s handcrafted philosophy through natural textures, warm tones, and storytelling elements. Every page is built within a 12-column CSS Grid, showcasing the careful balance between structure and artistry.
